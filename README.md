# UltimateTicTacToe

This game has a console UI and is modeled after the popular Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe board game: https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/

To play, run the ultimateTicTacToe.py file.

Note: This variant of the game requires that all mini tic-tac-toes must yield results (X wins, O wins, or tie) and the player who has won the most number of mini tic-tac-toes wins the whole game.
